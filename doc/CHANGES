The changes lists was getting a bit big, so I have moved the pervious version
listings to this new CHANGES file.

THIS IS NOT DETAILED: It gives an idea of what has changed.

*** WHAT CHANGED IN VERSION 0.7

	. Another name change, I'm afraid. The three packages have been moved
	  into the X11:: namespace to ensure that they live happily with
	  other Perl modules. This means that you must add X11:: to the 'use'
	  statements.
	. This is now available as a redhat RPM.
	. All documentation, copyright details, and the cnvtto7.pl script
	  have been moved to a subdirectory named 'doc', to help with 
	  RPM organization.
	. PUP callbacks have been implemented. See the Xforms.functions file
	  for a warning note about some minor usage restrictions, otherwise
	  the API matches that of Xforms itself.
	. The 0.81 thru 0.85 demos have been removed. The 0.86 demos are under
	  the DEMOS directory, again to help with RPM organization (they get 
	  installed in the /usr/lib/Xforms4Perl/DEMOS directory by the RPM 
	  installation process, but stay in the distribution main directory
	  when installing from the tar file).
	. Install script removed in favour of native Perl module build
	  in X11 directory.
	. All non-standard package make procedures either removed or 
	  automatically generated by MakeMaker (I took the time to learn how
	  in works!!)
	. All make warnings fixed. AIX and HP-UX make failures fixed.


*** WHAT CHANGED IN VERSION 0.5/0.6

	. Single package named 'Xforms' replaces all Forms_* packages
	. Package version numbers conform to Perl standards
	. OpenGL support is conditionally 'enable-able' using C compiler 
	  directives to include or exclude it based upon a symbol defined 
	  (or not) in the makefile
	. Extensive use of 'ALIAS'es in the xsubs allows a huge reduction
	  in the Xforms library size
	. Consequently this version will not compile in Perl 5.001
	  environments (actually its the xs compiler that is the problem)
	. XEvent and XFontStruct packages also enjoy size reduction benefits
	  from alias usage.
	. FD_FSELECTOR, FD_CMDLOG (>=0.84), FL_EditKeymap(>=0.85) , and FL_IOPT
	  structures defined as Perl objects
	. Extensive write access added to fields of FL_OBJECT and FL_FORM.
	. Pixmap and bitmap data support added
	. 0.84 and 0.85 changes and additions 
	. Forms 0.81, 0.84, 0.85 and 0.86 supported (recompile required on 
	  version change) with constant values reflecting the correct version 
	  (yes some did change their values between versions!)
	. Old cnvrtfd.pl fdesign file converter modified to be a valid
	  fdesign filter, and renamed to fd2Perl.
	. Conversion routine to move 0.4 scripts to 0.6 added.

*** WHAT IMPROVED BETWEEN THE FIRST CUT AND VERSION 0.4

	. obviously the huge increase in supported functions. 
	. fl_initialize now supports the FL_CMD_OPT parameters. 
	. the fl...resource functions are now supported.
	. There are also fixes to the very weak callback mechanism I used in 
	  the first one - like no longer ignoring warnings in the Perlcall 
	  manual page!! 
	. The compile should now be completely warning free due to the 
	  addition of a typemap fix that gets rid of the const violation 
	  warnings. 
	. XEvent structures are registered as Perl objects of class XEventPtr. 
	  Using the separate, but jointly delivered XEventPtr extension 
	  (found in the XEvent directory), you can access the XEvent 
	  structures returned by some Forms functions. 
	. XFontStruct structures are registered as Perl objects of class 
	  XFontStructPtr. Using the separate, but jointly delivered XEventPtr 
	  extension (found in the XFontStruct directory), you can manipulate 
	  the XFontStruct structures used by some Forms functions. 
	. You now have read access to the more interesting fields in the 
	  FL_OBJECT and FL_FORM structures (via Perl OO syntax - $form->window 
	  for instance) and you have read AND WRITE access to the u_vdata and 
	  u_ldata fields in those structures (again, via Perl OO syntax - see 
	  DEMOS/free1.pl for an example) PLEASE NOTE: The u_vdata field you 
	  access is NOT the REAL one, it's in a structure I chain off the real 
	  one - so don't try and mess with the real one.
	. The XFtool DEMO is a more solid implementation of a toolbar, with
	  tooltips and command-line and pixmap browse/edit facilities.
	. Finally, the entire package has been broken into a number of modules 
	  to help with run time speed (most standard applications will only 
	  require one or two of the modules).
