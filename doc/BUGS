None.

Well, ok, none I am aware of.

There is, however, one strange occurence when running the xyplotall.pl demo 
on xforms 0.84 - it crashes the X server! It does on my setup, anyway. Since I 
have recreated this using plain C, it is not considered to be an Xforms4Perl 
bug. Its not even acknowledged as an xforms bug since I appear to be the only 
one who has experienced this. I would be VERY interested with news from anyone
else who can make it happen. I do it be running the xyplotall.pl demo an number
of times consecutively.
